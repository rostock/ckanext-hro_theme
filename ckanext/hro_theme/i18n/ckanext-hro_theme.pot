" <h2>What is %(site_title)s?</h2> <p>Where exactly is the primary school "
"located that is closest to your home and therefore can be reached by your "
"children without having to cross many roads? Is your place of work directly "
"connected with your home via cycle ways? Will there be road works again on "
"your route to the sports ground next Sunday? Data to answer many, many "
"questions like these is out there on the internet somewhere but it is not "
"always easy to find.</p> <p>%(site_title)s is a web application serving as a "
"catalogue of useful sets of data. It is run by the municipality of Rostock "
"which is also the owner and publisher of the data. You can collect data here "
"for yourself and others to use. Depending on the type of data, %(site_title)s"
" may also be able to host it in a database, and provide some basic "
"visualisation tools.</p> <h2>How does it work?</h2> <p>This site is running a"
" powerful piece of open-source data cataloguing software called <a "
"href=\"https://ckan.org\" target=\"_blank\">CKAN</a>, written and maintained "
"by the <a href=\"https://okfn.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge "
"Foundation</a>. Each dataset record on CKAN contains a description of the "
"data and other useful information, such as what formats it is available in, "
"whether it is freely available, and what subject areas the data is about. One"
" can improve or add to this information (CKAN keeps a fully versioned "
"history).</p> <p i18n:msg=\"\">CKAN powers a number of data catalogues on the"
" Internet. <a href=\"https://datahub.io\" target=\"_blank\">The Data Hub</a> "
"is an openly editable open data catalogue, in the style of Wikipedia. The UK "
"Government uses CKAN to run <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk\" "
"target=\"_blank\">data.gov.uk</a>, which currently lists 8,000 government "
"datasets. Official public data from most European countries is listed in a "
"CKAN catalogue at <a href=\"http://publicdata.eu\" "
"target=\"_blank\">publicdata.eu</a>. There is a comprehensive list of "
"catalogues like these around the world at <a href=\"http://dataportals.org\" "
"target=\"_blank\">dataportals.org</a>, which is itself powered by CKAN.</p> "
"<h2>Open data and the Open Knowledge Foundation</h2> <p>Most of the data "
"indexed at %(site_title)s are openly licensed, meaning anyone is free to use "
"or re-use the data however they like. Perhaps someone will take that nice "
"dataset of a city's public art that you found, and add it to a tourist map, "
"or even make a neat app for your phone that will help you find artworks when "
"you visit the city. Open data means more enterprise, collaborative science "
"and transparent government. You can read more about open data in the <a "
"href=\"http://opendatahandbook.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data "
"Handbook</a>.</p> <p i18n:msg=\"\">The <a href=\"https://okfn.org\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> is a non-profit organisation "
"<a href=\"https://okfn.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">promoting</a> open "
"knowledge: writing and improving CKAN is one of the ways we do that. If you "
"want to get involved with its design or code, join the discussion or "
"development <a href=\"https://ckan.org/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">mailing"

" <p>%(site_title)s not only comes with an intuitive user interface but also "
"with an extensive application programming interface (API). The API "
"facilitates the use of all functionalities provided by the open-source data "
"cataloguing software CKAN which is at the basis of %(site_title)s: searching "
"for datasets, viewing the metadata (descriptive information) of a specific "
"dataset, or filtering the contents of ressources and linking ressources.</p> "
"<p>As both input and output format, the API uses <a "
"href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation\" "
"target=\"_blank\">JSON</a>. An example API call (to show the dataset "
"<code>apotheken</code>) looks like this: <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/package_show?id=apotheken\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_show?id=apotheken</a>.</p> <p>A "
"detailed description of the application programming interface can be found "
"within the <a href=\"%(api_doc_url)s\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> of"
" CKAN.</p> <h2>Searching for datasets and viewing metadata</h2> <p><a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/package_search?q=apothek\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_search?q=apothek</a></p> <p>On calling "
"the above URL, datasets are searched for containing the search key "
"<code>apothek</code>. During the search process various metadata fields are "
"scanned and therefore all datasets are returned as results that contain the "
"search key in one of their metadata fields.</p> <p>Once the wanted dataset "
"and hence its ID was identified amongst the search results, all the "
"information of the dataset can now be queried by calling the following URL "
"(of which the last part equals the dataset ID):</p> <p><a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/package_show?id=652e7b9e-5bb2-4a7e-aeff-12421d3c32a5\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_show?id=652e7b9e-5bb2-4a7e-aeff-"
"12421d3c32a5</a>.</p> <p>A (shortened) result, then, could appear as "
"follows:</p> <pre class=\"well\">{ help: […], success: true, result: { id: "
"\"652e7b9e-5bb2-4a7e-aeff-12421d3c32a5\", name: \"apotheken\", title: "

"}, […] ], […] }</pre> <p>The output is very comprehensive and should be "
"analysed in detail during the first queries. The most important information "
"in the above (shortened) result is: <ul> <li>A ressource in CSV file format "
"is available under <a "
"href=\"https://geo.sv.rostock.de/download/opendata/apotheken/apotheken.csv\" "
"target=\"_blank\">https://geo.sv.rostock.de/download/opendata/apotheken/apotheken.csv</a>."
" It is 18081 bytes in size. What is very important in terms of a ressource is"
" its hash value which can be used for proving the integrity of the file.</li>"
" <li>The tags (key words) assigned to this dataset are of interest "
"particularly for searching purposes.</li> <li>The dataset is allocated to "
"category <code>08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-70511004a405</code>. A list of all datasets or "
"further information of a certain category can be viewed either by using the "
"web interface or by calling the API: <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/group_show?id=08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-70511004a405\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/group_show?id=08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-"
"70511004a405</a>.</li> <li>The dataset provides a description with additional"
" details such as the update interval or information about the contents of the"
" ressources.</li> </ul> </p> <h2>Filtering the contents of ressources and "
"linking ressources</h2> <p>Particularly when mobile devices are used or when "
"only a low data transfer rate is available, it is advantageous to be able to "
"download specific extracts of ressources (i.e. to filter ressources) and not "
"having to download the complete ressources: The CKAN DataStore which is "
"enabled for certain ressources provides the functionality of filtering. To "
"check whether the DataStore is enabled for a certain ressource either the web"
" interface can be used (via the site listing all the details of the "
"ressource) or the API can be called by passing the correspondent "
"ressource ID (e.g. the ID <code>290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-65a0ee140a45</code>): <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/datastore_search?resource_id=290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-"
"65a0ee140a45\" target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/datastore_search?resource_id"
"=290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-65a0ee140a45</a>. The output will consist either of "
"an error message (if the DataStore is not enabled) or of all the contents of "
"the DataStore for this particular ressource.</p> <p>If the DataStore is "
"enabled for a certain ressource, either simple operations can be executed "
"(with the already shown <code>datastore_search</code> function) or more complex operations"
" such as SQL queries can be executed (with the <code>datastore_search_sql</code> "
"function). When using SQL queries, all columns that shall be presented in the"
" result must be explicitly indicated: otherwise errors may arise.</p> <p>A "
"simple example for linking two datasets by means of location and, at the same"
" time, for filtering the contents based on location as well could appear as "
"follows:</p> <pre class=\"well\">SELECT bezeichnung, strasse_name, "
"hausnummer, hausnummer_zusatz FROM \"0c2c4996-afad-4ebe-9a3d-a3a7d7047a4d\" "
"WHERE ST_Within(ST_Transform(geometrie,25833),ST_Buffer(ST_Transform((SELECT "
"geometrie FROM \"e614d725-4fad-4447-820d-4475ca55cff5\" WHERE bezeichnung = "
"'Deutsche Med'),25833),300))</pre> <p>This command can be executed via the "
"API by calling the following URL:</p> <p><a target=\"_blank\" "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%%20bezeichnung,%%20strasse_name,%%20hausnummer,%%20hausnummer_zusatz%%20FROM%%20%%220c2c4996"

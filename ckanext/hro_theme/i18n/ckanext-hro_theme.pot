" <h2>What is %(site_title)s?</h2> <p>Where exactly is the primary school "
"located that is closest to your home and therefore can be reached by your"
" children without having to cross many roads? Is your place of work "
"directly connected with your home via cycle ways? Will there be road "
"works again on your route to the sports ground next Sunday? Data to "
"answer many, many questions like these is out there on the internet "
"somewhere but it is not always easy to find.</p> <p>%(site_title)s is a "
"web application serving as a catalogue of useful sets of data. It is run "
"by the municipality of Rostock which is also the owner and publisher of "
"the data. You can collect data here for yourself and others to use. "
"Depending on the type of data, %(site_title)s may also be able to host it"
" in a database, and provide some basic visualisation tools.</p> <h2>How "
"does it work?</h2> <p>This site is running a powerful piece of open-"
"source data cataloguing software called <a href=\"https://ckan.org\" "
"target=\"_blank\">CKAN</a>, written and maintained by the <a "
"href=\"https://okfn.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge "
"Foundation</a>. Each dataset record on CKAN contains a description of the"
" data and other useful information, such as what formats it is available "
"in, whether it is freely available, and what subject areas the data is "
"about. One can improve or add to this information (CKAN keeps a fully "
"versioned history).</p> <p i18n:msg=\"\">CKAN powers a number of data "
"catalogues on the Internet. <a href=\"https://datahub.io\" "
"target=\"_blank\">The Data Hub</a> is an openly editable open data "
"catalogue, in the style of Wikipedia. The UK Government uses CKAN to run "
"<a href=\"https://data.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\">data.gov.uk</a>, which "
"currently lists 8,000 government datasets. Official public data from most"
" European countries is listed in a CKAN catalogue at <a "
"href=\"http://publicdata.eu\" target=\"_blank\">publicdata.eu</a>. There "
"is a comprehensive list of catalogues like these around the world at <a "
"href=\"http://dataportals.org\" target=\"_blank\">dataportals.org</a>, "
"which is itself powered by CKAN.</p> <h2>Open data and the Open Knowledge"
" Foundation</h2> <p>Most of the data indexed at %(site_title)s are openly"
" licensed, meaning anyone is free to use or re-use the data however they "
"like. Perhaps someone will take that nice dataset of a city's public art "
"that you found, and add it to a tourist map, or even make a neat app for "
"your phone that will help you find artworks when you visit the city. Open"
" data means more enterprise, collaborative science and transparent "
"government. You can read more about open data in the <a "
"href=\"http://opendatahandbook.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data "
"Handbook</a>.</p> <p i18n:msg=\"\">The <a href=\"https://okfn.org\" "

" <p>%(site_title)s not only comes with an intuitive user interface but "
"also with an extensive application programming interface (API). The API "
"facilitates the use of all functionalities provided by the open-source "
"data cataloguing software CKAN which is at the basis of %(site_title)s: "
"searching for datasets, viewing the metadata (descriptive information) of"
" a specific dataset, or filtering the contents of ressources and linking "
"ressources.</p> <p>As both input and output format, the API uses <a "
"href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation\" "
"target=\"_blank\">JSON</a>. An example API call (to show the dataset "
"<code>apotheken</code>) looks like this: <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/package_show?id=apotheken\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_show?id=apotheken</a>.</p> <p>A "
"detailed description of the application programming interface can be "
"found within the <a href=\"%(api_doc_url)s\" "
"target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> of CKAN.</p> <h2>Searching for "
"datasets and viewing metadata</h2> <p><a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/package_search?q=apothek\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_search?q=apothek</a></p> <p>On "
"calling the above URL, datasets are searched for containing the search "
"key <code>apothek</code>. During the search process various metadata "
"fields are scanned and therefore all datasets are returned as results "
"that contain the search key in one of their metadata fields.</p> <p>Once "
"the wanted dataset and hence its ID was identified amongst the search "
"results, all the information of the dataset can now be queried by calling"
" the following URL (of which the last part equals the dataset ID):</p> "
"<p><a href=\"%(api_url)s/package_show?id=652e7b9e-5bb2-4a7e-aeff-"
"12421d3c32a5\" target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/package_show?id=652e7b9e-"
"5bb2-4a7e-aeff-12421d3c32a5</a>.</p> <p>A (shortened) result, then, could"
" appear as follows:</p> <pre class=\"well\">{ help: […], success: true, "
"result: { id: \"652e7b9e-5bb2-4a7e-aeff-12421d3c32a5\", name: "

"<p>The output is very comprehensive and should be analysed in detail "
"during the first queries. The most important information in the above "
"(shortened) result is: <ul> <li>A ressource in CSV file format is "
"available under <a "

" "
"target=\"_blank\">https://geo.sv.rostock.de/download/opendata/apotheken/apotheken.csv</a>."
" It is 18081 bytes in size. What is very important in terms of a "
"ressource is its hash value which can be used for proving the integrity "
"of the file.</li> <li>The tags (key words) assigned to this dataset are "
"of interest particularly for searching purposes.</li> <li>The dataset is "
"allocated to category <code>08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-70511004a405</code>. "
"A list of all datasets or further information of a certain category can "
"be viewed either by using the web interface or by calling the API: <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/group_show?id=08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-70511004a405\" "
"target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/group_show?id=08b0e154-77d7-440f-ab7b-"
"70511004a405</a>.</li> <li>The dataset provides a description with "
"additional details such as the update interval or information about the "
"contents of the ressources.</li> </ul> </p> <h2>Filtering the contents of"
" ressources and linking ressources</h2> <p>Particularly when mobile "
"devices are used or when only a low data transfer rate is available, it "
"is advantageous to be able to download specific extracts of ressources "
"(i.e. to filter ressources) and not having to download the complete "
"ressources: The CKAN DataStore which is enabled for certain ressources "
"provides the functionality of filtering. To check whether the DataStore "
"is enabled for a certain ressource either the web interface can be used "
"(via the site listing all the details of the ressource) or the API can be"
" called by passing the correspondent ressource ID (e.g. the ID <code"
">290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-65a0ee140a45</code>): <a "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/datastore_search?resource_id=290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-"
"65a0ee140a45\" target=\"_blank\">%(api_url)s/datastore_search?resource_id"
"=290cdf3c-33eb-44a8-963e-65a0ee140a45</a>. The output will consist either"
" of an error message (if the DataStore is not enabled) or of all the "
"contents of the DataStore for this particular ressource.</p> <p>If the "
"DataStore is enabled for a certain ressource, either simple operations "
"can be executed (with the already shown <code>datastore_search</code> "
"function) or more complex operations such as SQL queries can be executed "
"(with the <code>datastore_search_sql</code> function). When using SQL "
"queries, all columns that shall be presented in the result must be "
"explicitly indicated: otherwise errors may arise.</p> <p>A simple example"
" for linking two datasets by means of location and, at the same time, for"
" filtering the contents based on location as well could appear as "
"follows:</p> <pre class=\"well\">SELECT bezeichnung, strasse_name, "
"hausnummer, hausnummer_zusatz FROM \"0c2c4996-afad-4ebe-9a3d-"
"a3a7d7047a4d\" WHERE "

" = 'Deutsche Med'),25833),300))</pre> <p>This command can be executed via"
" the API by calling the following URL:</p> <p><a target=\"_blank\" "
"href=\"%(api_url)s/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%%20bezeichnung,%%20strasse_name,%%20hausnummer,%%20hausnummer_zusatz%%20FROM%%20%%220c2c4996"
